> Magicbane is an emulator for the long dead but much beloved Ubisoft MMO, [Shadowbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowbane).
The project was founded in 2013 with the concept of free availability of gameplay; players unencumbered by any factor other than a desire to again play a game they once loved.  A game where the developers do not play is guaranteed to be the fairest game.

The Magicbane Team has wanted to open source Shadowbane for half a decade.  We are excited to now finally have the opportunity, along with some new technology, to truly democratize Shadowbane.

- Written in some 80k lines of Java 8 and bash.
- Project with real infrastructure; Production and development servers supporting multiple containerized apps.
- MagicBox container technology enables _instant deployment_ and trouble free development on modest hardware.
- MagicBox plugin capability allows for new and interesting player experiences.
